# Note-Taker

## Description
The following is a note taking application that can be used to create, view, and delete notes. As part of the Module 11 challenge in the ASU Bootcamp, we were given completed front-end code, and then tasked with building the back end, such that the application would 
become a fully functional full-stack project. This application primarily employs the use of Express.js to build the back-end, as well as fs, js, and uuid for additional dependencies. The website itself contains fields for 'Note Title', and 'Note Text', with buttons to 'Save Note' or 'Clear Form' after entering in text. It also has a section which shows created notes, that can either be viewed or deleted. The following image is an example of what one may see upon opening the Note Taker

## Usage
In order to use the Note Taker, start by populating the 'Note Title' and 'Note Text' fields. Next, click 'Save Note' once you're ready to create your new note. After this, your note will appear in the left hand column, which you can click on to view your note, or any other notes. Also, each note will have a trashcan icon that can be pressed to delete the note. The following image is an example of what one may see after creating some notes.
